It is a great pleasure for me to send a few words to the website of Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala, which would indeed reflect every sphere of the Alma Mater. I feel truly honored to serve as the leading head of this prestigious school and take this opportunity to express my best wishes and congratulations to the College IT Society for launching this website.
