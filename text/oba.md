The Maliyadeva College Old Boys' Association:Nurturing Tradition and Community Founded on the historic day of Saturday, July 13th, 1936, the Maliyadeva College Old Boys' Association (O.B.A) stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of Maliyadeva College. Initiated by the visionary efforts of the Most Rev. Nakette Ananda, the association was established shortly after the school's relocation from Kandy Road to its present location on Negombo Road. This marked the beginning of a journey that would foster camaraderie among former students and contribute significantly to the growth and enrichment of both the institution and its alumni.
