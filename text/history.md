In June 1888, a new school with one student was opened at a place in Bodhiraja Mawatha near the present Central Bus Stand in Kurunegala, by Semenaries A. Bamunu-Arachchige. He was a young Maha-Vidane (Vidane Arachchi ) who had been put in charge of four villages by Maha-Mudaliyar Bandaranaike and Colonel Henry Steel Olcott. He was assisted by local donors, Hulugalle, Adikaram and Mudaliyar Attygala. The school was named Kurunegala Buddhist Institution.

By 1908, the number of students had risen to one hundred, still under the leadership of Maha-Vidane Semenaries. In 1909, the school was moved to a new premises at a Buddhist Temple, Ethkanda Viharaya, along the Kandy â€“ Kurunegala main road. This decision was made by the Mudaliyar Bandaranaike and Maha Vidane Semenaries.
